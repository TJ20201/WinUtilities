# WinUtilities
WinUtilities is a PowerShell-based GUI with features such as deleting most bloatware and feature enabling.

## Usages
To use WinUtilities, clone the repository to where you would like WinUtilities to be installed if you haven't already. Once that is done, double-click on `launch.bat` and when you get a User Account Control (UAC) prompt press Confirm. After pressing confirm, an Administrator PowerShell will pop up where you must enter the directory where WinUtilities is installed including the `src` folder, for example `C:/Development/WinUtilities/src` if `WinUtilities` is found in the `Development` folder under the `C` drive. If it's in your `Downloads`, it'd be something such as `C:/Users/[user]/Downloads/WinUtilities/src` and so on.
<br>Please note that your directory for `WinUtilities` may not always be `WinUtilities` and something such as `WinUtilities-master`. This doesn't affect anything other than you have to replace `WinUtilities` with the name you have for it when PowerShell appears.
