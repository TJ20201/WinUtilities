# WinUtilities
WinUtilities is a PowerShell-based GUI with features such as deleting most bloatware and feature enabling.

## Usages
To use WinUtilities, you can refer to this step-by-step tutorial below.
  - [1] Clone WinUtilities to any directory if you haven't already
  - [2] Go to the WinUtilities directory
  - [3] Inside of WinUtilities, double-click on `launch.bat`
  - [4] Accept the UAC prompt to proceed with administrator permissions
  - [5] In the new Windows PowerShell prompt, input the directory where WinUtilities is located with "/src" on the end for WorkingDirectory
  - [6] The WorkingDirectory should look something like this: `[drive]:/Users/[user]/.../WinUtilities/src`
  - [7] Press enter, and if all steps are correctly entered a GUI should appear
<br>Please note that your directory for `WinUtilities` may not always be `WinUtilities` and something such as `WinUtilities-master`. This doesn't affect anything other than you have to replace `WinUtilities` with the name you have for it when PowerShell appears.
